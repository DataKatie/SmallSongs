This website has been produced as an educational site in partnership with Humber College, under the supervision of
Nithya R. Thayananthan.

The following is an explanation to my professor concerning the learning elements applied within the site.

The home page can be accessed through the link to index.html. Other sites include current.html, past.html, 
songwriting.html, gallery.html, submissions.html, submitted.html, and poet_biographies.html.
smallsongscss.css is the cascading style sheet that provides formatting and style to the webpage.
Classes have been created to apply formatting to common elements.
Photos, images, and embedded media content have been included and are styled using css.
javaScript and jQuery have been used to create an accordian, dialog boxes, an interactive menu that allows
you to scroll to a selected element, and form validation.
