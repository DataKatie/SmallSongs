         <p>
        Poetry can also be expressed using music. Writing original songs requires
        construction of lyrics as well as a corresponding melody. Below are 
        two original songs written by Katie Sullivan.</p>
        
         <h2> Here A While </h2>

         <h2> Ten Thousand Miles Past </h2>
         <iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Yahd2xxvGw" 
                 frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         
         <h2> Mathematical Pi </h2>
         <p> While traditional song-writing uses original music and lyrics, parody is a time-honored tradition where
        a pre-existing song is alerted with new lyrics to create a new and often 
        amusing meaning. Please enjoy a video featuring a song about the mathematical
        constant pi to the tune of the famous song "American Pie by Don McLean"
         </p>
