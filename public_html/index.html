            <h2> About Haiku </h2>
            <p> Haiku is traditional Japanese poetry form composed of 3 lines, 
                each with a specific number of syllables. Traditionally, the 
                first line has 5 syllables, the second line has 7 syllables, and
                the final line again has 5 syllables. Haiku poems are frequently
                about nature and rarely use similes and metaphors. </p>
