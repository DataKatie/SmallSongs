      <h3> Where the Landscape Listens</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
            Dark clouds brood on the horizon: <br>
convolutions of the brain.<br>
The sky knits its brows together, <br>
anxious over the curve of the bay. <br>
Even the highway hugs us close, <br>
the protective arm, clutching tight <br>
across the shoulders of the hills <br>
as the earth bows down in grace. 
        </p> <p>
(and we race on <br>
hard against the wind <br>
in a spray of sand <br>
urged by the chill closing in – <br>
that soft eager breath <br>
whispering in our open ears – <br>
cold settling snug upon our noses <br>
our bare fingers and toes) 
        </p><p>
We hold each other safe<br>
here, where the landscape listens<br>
and exchange our stories<br>
with the sea. The tides sigh<br>
as though in response, but<br>
they do not speak our language.<br>
We wait patiently for understanding, <br>
for a shower of stars, a dreamless sleep; 
        </p> <p>
here, where the landscape listens <br>
under the round eye<br>
of the watchful moon.
   
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Three One Line Poems </h3>

    <div>

        <p>Seafoam mares canter the moonroad: 
        though buoyant with night air, 
        we are left behind in the swirl of the tide on the beach.</p>
        
        <p>
        At the heart of this skeleton farmhouse a campfire
        </p>
        <p>Cornflowers blue a sun-soaked meadow drowsy with crickets </p>
        
    

  </div>

  <h3> Attitudes of Pearl</h3>

  <div>

    
        
        <p>
            She comes to me on these iron-cold days, <br>
        hard on the heels of the year’s close. <br>
        Today bruised skylines withdraw their mourning<br>
        as the scent of decay rises crunching with our footsteps.<br>
        Empty-handed, we offer each other our open palms,<br>
        but we do not possess a single word between us.<br>
        </p> <p>
        Instead we are language-thieves, snatching<br>
        phrases, ringing rhymes, and lost metaphors<br>
        as they echo down the years in endless singing rounds.<br>
        We hoard each precious syllable as slumbering dragonesses <br>
        hidden beneath treacherous mountain ranges <br>
        with one eye fixed on cold stolen gold. <br>
        </p> <p>
        Listen. They wait for us behind their words,<br>
        Barry, Samuel, and all the Williams,<br>
        no longer in the old country where Pearl’s slate <br>
        lies broken and bleeding chalk dust <br>
        but here, across the ocean in a paper boat <br>
        manned with ink blots and wood lice.<br>
        </p> <p> 
        They are the dead, but live on <br>
        in the mingled measure from the fountain <br>
        and the caves, in that dome built in air,<br>
        having dared to seize the fire with conviction <br>
        while wishing for the cloths of Heaven and <br>
        dreaming ceaselessly of Pearl. <br>
        </p> <p>
        I can lay no claim to her, that <br>
        windswept spirit waist-deep in the borage. <br>
        She is not my accomplice, for <br>
        I have stolen her too, now only a <br>
        strung necklace of words unravelled <br>
        to alphabet in my mouth and bitter burnt ash. <br>
        </p>

      <h3>Courtice Road</h3>

    <div>


        <h4> At Courtice Road </h4>
<p> Dust settles in the parking lot<br>
in a gritty layer of memories.<br>
Not like the sedimentary rock,<br>
that great boon to archaeologists,<br>
which houses the past neatly in distinct strata<br>
ready to be excavated, pieced together,<br>
put on display. Even the barest idea<br>
of a breeze would displace these<br>
tiny grains of thought and feeling<br>
that make memory whole.<br>
The tracks written in the dirt<br>
at my feet tell a different story,<br>
as the car merges back onto the highway.<br>
I am left behind. I taste the sand on my tongue,<br>
swallow roughly so it will be part of me<br>
forever after. </p>

<h4> Forgotten village of Clarington </h4>
<p> What was this once but old farmland<br>
or first deep dark fairy tale forest?<br>
The haunt of the much-maligned wolf,<br>
black bear and soft-footed First Nations tribe<br>
where the sun never fully penetrates<br>
to woodland floor and deep lakes conceal their secrets.<br>
Then forest felled to make way for<br>
foreign farmers, fat livestock and the idea of a country.<br>
We arrived in 1850 to settle here<br>
and give our names to the land.<br>
This land is our land, from the bone of stone<br>
right up to the blue ideal of sky.<br>
We will remain, even to outlast<br>
the old wagon shop on the corner<br>
that now sells cars and fire will not take us<br>
as it did that blackened charred mess<br>
of an eyesore just off the highway. </p>

<h4> Directions to Courtice </h4>
<p> Gaze into the distance and let your eyes unfocus.<br>
First picture a green Subaru, heavily packed<br>
and alone on the highway.<br>
Imagine the noise of two grandparents<br>
arguing the perfect route<br>
a restless dog barking<br>
the leaking headphones of a Walkman<br>
and the repeated question of, “Are we there yet?<br>
Feel your belly empty because you haven’t yet had breakfast<br>
and note the mounting irritability that accompanies hunger.<br>
This is how to arrive at Courtice.<br>
When each image and sound overlaps<br>
then you will be there immediately<br>
no matter how far away you were before. </p>

<h4> Breakfast on the road </h4>
<p> Is it time yet? No, never now<br>
until the curve in the road reveals<br>
the branching possibility of diversion<br>
that takes shape as a great old grey barn.<br>
Will we stop? Will we stop?<br>
We will stop. We always stop. We stop.<br>
We stop for greasy bacon and eggs.<br>
We stop for bitter coffee and pulpy orange juice.<br>
We stop to let the dog run in crazed, glorious circles.<br>
We stop for the comfort of tradition.<br>
We stop to say that we have reached the first stop.<br>
We stop to marvel that the place has not changed.<br>
We stop because it is a place on the map we recognize.<br>
We stop to remember that we used to stop here once.<br>
We stop to mourn what is no longer here. </p>

<h4> A short history of Courtice </h4>
<p> I do not know its past except<br>
where it overlaps with my own.<br>
We only knew each other casually,<br>
this place and I, meeting twice a year<br>
for breakfast on the return voyage north.<br>
These meals were sleepy affairs with little<br>
in the way of conversation.<br>
I never asked if it had been a farm,<br>
once, or what its aspirations were<br>
if in the future it should be a restaurant no longer.<br>
For its part Courtice never asked me<br>
where I was going or if<br>
I liked the eggs. </p>
<h4> The time traveller’s dilemma </h4>
<p> Praise the dandelion clock, that<br>
bends the facts of time to its own imaginings:<br>
each puff strikes the hour and propels<br>
a new once upon a time for every traveller.<br>
I can journey forward or back in time<br>
on only the power of thought, except<br>
the measure of control is an illusion<br>
and it is impossible to say to when I am going.<br>
What will I find when I arrive?<br>
It could be a small girl and her dog<br>
or clusters of strangers clamouring to be fed.<br>
I could suffocate in the dense smoke<br>
of fire uncontrolled or loose myself in the mystery<br>
of glacial prehistory, with only my bones<br>
surviving to tell my story.</p>
<h4> Portrait of Courtice </h4>
<p> I could paint Courtice<br>
as if it were a landscape<br>
by one of the Group of Seven –<br>
a landmark in memory softened<br>
in contour, boundary, and colour<br>
as it filters through the lens of feeling<br>
buffeted by the vagaries of time<br>
until it becomes a scraggly pine tree<br>
desperately clinging to a barren rock.<br>
Instead I will attempt a portrait<br>
to reinvent the revenant.<br>
If I resurrect the long neck of the road<br>
as it curves to meet the tilt of the sharp-angled<br>
barn-door chin in perfect detail<br>
I will bring it to life once more<br>
to exist under the scrutiny of my jealous guard. </p>
<h4> Missing Courtice </h4>
<p> You are not the one I miss<br>
with the spring-thaw flood<br>
of heartache sealed tight<br>
behind a dam of forget.<br>
I can live without you, Courtice.<br>
If I wanted, I could think<br>
never again of the nothing you are<br>
to me, except that when I return<br>
to you, there she is waiting for me,<br>
the top of her grey head<br>
barely visible above the steering wheel<br>
and the dog running happy laps<br>
around and around the open car.<br>
But when I go to leave you behind<br>
forever, I will be left with only<br>
ringing barks echoing in my ears. </p>
<h4> A Portrait of Missing Courtice </h4>

<h4> Directions to Breakfast </h4>
<p> This is how to arrive at Courtice.<br>
First picture greasy bacon and eggs,<br>
bitter coffee and pulpy orange juice,<br>
with a side of mounting irritability.<br>
Then ask the question, “Are we there yet?”<br>
Will we stop? Are we there yet?<br>
We’re there when the restless dog is barking.<br>
We’re there when the green Subaru is on the highway.<br>
We’re there when both grandparents argue the perfect route.<br>
We’re there when Courtice has not changed.<br>
We’re there when it becomes a place we no longer recognize.<br>
We’re there to take comfort in tradition.<br>
When will we stop? Will we stop? </p>
<h4> The time traveller arrives at a forgotten village </h4>
<p> What was this once but a<br>
praised dandelion clock, lying spent<br>
in old farmland or deep dark fairy tale forest?<br>
Bending the facts of time to its own imagining,<br>
the hour strikes anew in the haunt of<br>
much-maligned wolf and soft-footed First Nations tribe.<br>
I can journey here where the sun never fully penetrates<br>
to woodland floor on only the power of thought<br>
when we arrived in 1850 to settle here<br>
a cluster of strangers clamouring to be fed<br>
and give our names to the land.<br>
This land our land from glacial prehistory<br>
until the suffocating dense smoke of fire uncontrolled<br>
outlasts the old wagon shop on the corner<br>
and that small girl and her dog.</p>
<h4>Courtice Road Forgotten </h4>
<p> Sedimentary rock praises dandelion clock<br>
layered strata reveal nothing<br>
no real boon to archaeologists.<br>
Image and sound overlaps past and present,<br>
arriving in 1850 to outlast glacial prehistory.<br>
A tiny breeze displaces these.<br>
Foreign farmers fell first forest<br>
and taste sand on their tongues.<br>
Headphones leak restless dog barking.<br>
Alone on the highway<br>
the curve of the road reveals<br>
fire uncontrolled.<br>
Deep lakes conceal surviving bones. </p>
<h4> At Courtice Road </h4>
<p> I am left behind. I leave<br>
to leave you behind forever<br>
muttering, “Are we there yet?”<br>
over the noise of the perfect route.<br>
Alone on the highway, I gaze into the distance.<br>
The road reveals the branching possibility<br>
of journeying forward or back in time<br>
without aspirations or the desire for eggs.<br>
We only knew each other casually.<br>
I will filter through the lens of feeling<br>
to arrive at a place on the map I recognize<br>
dense smoke shrouding tradition in comfort.<br>
Breakfast in the forgotten village<br>
Car merges to scraggly pine tree<br>
though the highway desperately clings<br>
to tradition and navigates the perfect route<br>
through a wind of forget.<br>
Even the map wouldn’t recognize this place –<br>
farmland grows rock for crop<br>
and trees march inside the barn, ousting cattle.<br>
The restaurant endures bravely,<br>
serving up breakfast peppered<br>
with the dust of memory<br>
a picnic in the wildwood wolf haunt.<br>
The only constant is the dog barking.<br>
The eggs burn in a fire<br>
that may not have happened yet. </p>
<h4> Dear Courtice </h4>
<p> No, you were right to say<br>
that summer road trips across<br>
South-Eastern Ontario would not<br>
be the same without you.<br>
It was not your brazen confidence<br>
in my attachment to you<br>
that precipitated my long silence.<br>
There is nothing left to say.<br>
I do not go your way anymore;<br>
you are changed beyond recognition.<br>
One day the light lying<br>
across an empty highway at dawn<br>
will bring passing thought of you.<br>
Do not write me again.
