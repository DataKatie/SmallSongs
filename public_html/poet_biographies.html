        <h3>Editor and Contributor: Tamara DeDominicis</h3>
        <img class ="photo" src ='tamara.jpg' alt ='A picture of Tamara' width =
             '200' height ='200'/>
        <p class = "description"> Tamara DeDominicis is a poet who listens to the whispers of the wind 
        and the roaring of the tides. In the spring, she can usually be found 
        beneath the boughs of blossoming cherry trees. Tamara's work has been 
        published in many anthologies including Three Line Poetry, and 50 Haikus
        </p>

        <img class ="photo" src="katie.jpg" alt="A picture of Katie" height ="196"
             width ="160" />
        <p class = "description"> Katie has been writing poetry since high school when she 
            enrolled in the school's only Friday afternoon extra-curricular 
            activity: creative writing club. She counts T.S. Elliot, Virgina Woolf, 
            and Leonard Cohen among her many inspirations. While she still enjoys 
            poetry, these days she prefers expressing her words in the form of songs,
            as an aspiring folk singer/songwriter. </p>

        <h3> Contributor: Jenni Suppa </h3>
        <img class="photo" src ="jenni.jpg" alt ="A picture of Jenni" height ="155"
             width="186" />
        <p class="description"> Jenni has had a love of the English language, since she first 
            discovered the joys of writing parody songs to the tune of 
            "American Pie" by Don McLean. Although her poetry is often funny in 
            nature, she has also discovered an enjoyment of words reflected in 
            nature. </p>

        <div class ="biography">
        <h3> Contributor: Angelica Barrone </h3>
        <p> Angelica enjoys writing short poetry forms, as well as longer novels,
            specifically targeted to young adult readers. Angelica enjoys taking
            part in NaNoWriMo, the novel-writing month of November. When she 
            can't be writing, Angelica keeps herself busy teaching elementary
            school students! </p>
